I've been wanting to make my own website for a while now to keep track of my projects. I first created a version of it a couple of years ago using a website builder; however, I've always envisioned building it on my own and now I'm one step closer! 

After doing some research, I decided to use <a href="https://www.namesilo.com/">NameSilo</a> to manage my domain and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host my site. It's also powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I'm using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> to write my posts. 

One of the more time-consuming tasks was trying to come up with a domain name. The default for most people is their name, but I tried every other combination of my own without much success. I wasn't surprised at all, given that I have the same name as a <a href="http://www.jackiechan.com/">movie star</a>. 

Because of the other Jackie Chan, I'm even more motivated to make my name known for something that <em>I've</em> accomplished. The hope is that one day I'll overhear a conversation like this:

Person 1: Hey, did you see what new project Jackie Chan's up to? It looks amazing!

Person 2: Yeah, Jackie Chan the scientist/engineer?

Person 1: Of course, what other Jackie Chan is there?!
